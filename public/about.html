<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>
I’m Sidharth Pundir, a Computer Science B.Tech student at Graphic Era University, originally from Saharanpur, with my schooling completed at Beverly Hills School, Dehradun.</p>

<p>I have hands-on experience through two projects — Crowd Density Estimation and Military Base Operations Management System (where I contributed as the GUI developer). I hold a Java certification and have also studied C and C++. Currently, I’ve solved 80+ problems on LeetCode and am working toward becoming a proficient problem-solver in competitive programming.</p>

<p>Outside academics, I’m passionate about fitness, cycling, and building the habit of reading. I’m inspired by challenges that require discipline, strategic thinking, and persistence. My goal is to secure a role in the tech industry while continuing to grow as a programmer — and if given the opportunity, I aspire to serve my country through the armed forces.</p>
